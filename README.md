# NHS Pension Calculator
#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pI3HloGjCsw
#### Description:
The NHS Pension calculator is a simple progressive web app. The app also contains a blog section where information about the NHS Pension can be found. It will also be hosted on Azure and will be public on pensioncalc.co.uk - hopefully very soon.

I am submitting this project as a first version, but will continue to work on it in the future, especially if it manages to attract any organic traffic. For this reason the product is SEO-optimized: mobile optimized and high pagespeed. The blog section is also keyword-rich and caters to a question which according to some basic research may be easy to rank for.

The future of pensioncalcs.co.uk involves the following updates:
- Allow for separate entries for each year in the scheme, leading to more accurate estimates.
- Account for inflation.
- Calculate lifetime contributions based on current rates.
- Calculators for older NHS pension schemes, and combined pensions.
- Comparison with other pension schemes.
- More blog posts about the pension and other similar pensions in the UK.
- More calculators for other pensions such as the teacher's pension.

The main difficulty in setting up this final project was not in the actual building of the calculator, but in understanding PWAs, the framework (lit/shoelace/typescript), and hosting on Azure.
